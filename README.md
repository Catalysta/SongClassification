# SongClassification
Final Project for graduate statistical consulting course. 

The main task of this project is to classify the selected music tracks from the Million Song Dataset into one of
25 genres based on pre-processed audio features contained in this dataset. Classification methods would
be evaluated by determining a priori, a test set and a training set. A secondary task of this project will be to
explore various metrics for assessing performance of multi-class classification methods, in order to recommend
the ”best” method for prediction.
